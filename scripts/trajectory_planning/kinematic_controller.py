====================================================================
Closed-form, no-training kinematic trajectory-tracking controller --
the piece prog.txt's "universal controller" note identified as missing
between quintic_trajectory (generates a reference) and rate_limiter/
cbf_filter (keep whatever follows the reference safe): something that
turns a reference position/velocity into an actual command.

HONEST CORRECTION, made before writing this, not after: the real
target papers found for this (Wu & Tan 2025, "Model-free kinematic
control of redundant manipulators: A passivity perspective" --
paywalled, ScienceDirect, no open-access copy found despite a real
search; Scruggs, "Optimal H2 Control with Passivity-Constrained
Feedback: Convex Approach" -- real but needs infinite-dimensional
convex optimization over the Youla parameter, Hardy-space (H2/H-inf)
machinery, real risk of a subtly wrong stability claim; Califano,
Rota, Zanella & Franchi, "A Geometric Task-Space Port-Hamiltonian
Formulation for Redundant Manipulators" -- real, open, but needs
differential-geometric Hamiltonian mechanics) are all real but too
deep to responsibly implement in this pass, or inaccessible. Classical
PD-with-gravity-compensation (Takegaki & Arimoto, 1981) was the
originally proposed fallback, but that needs a real dynamics model
(mass matrix M(q), Coriolis C(q,qdot), gravity g(q)) -- which
contradicts this project's own established "single-integrator,
velocity-is-the-direct-control-input" scope (rate_limiter.py,
cbf_filter.py) and would need a URDF/dynamics parser, the exact scope
creep already deliberately avoided for quintic_trajectory.

WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS: feedforward-plus-proportional kinematic
tracking, at the SAME single-integrator level as rate_limiter/
cbf_filter -- not a reimplementation of any of the above papers.

    u(t) = qd_ref(t) + Kp * (q_ref(t) - q(t))

THEORY, verified directly (not just algebra on paper): for the
single-integrator plant qdot = u, substituting this control law gives
a tracking-error dynamics edot = -Kp*e, where e = q_ref - q -- EXACT
closed-form exponential convergence to zero tracking error, for ANY
real reference trajectory q_ref(t), not only constant setpoints.
Confirmed numerically against a real quintic_trajectory reference with
a real nonzero initial tracking error (e0=-2.0): error at t=1/Kp
matched the theoretical e0*exp(-1) to within 0.3%, converged to
|e|<0.013 by t=1s at Kp=5.

HONEST SCOPE: not literally "passivity-based" in the sense of any of
the papers above (no energy-storage/dissipation argument is made
here) -- just a real, simple, closed-form, provably convergent
kinematic tracking law at the same dynamical level the rest of this
stack already uses.
