## 🔬 Scientific Discoveries & Empirical Evidence

### 1. Quantum Phase Transition & Order Parameters

We present a rigorous physical validation of the longitudinal spin-correlation order parameter $\langle H_{zz} \rangle$ governed by the 1D Transverse Field Ising Model Hamiltonian:

$$H = -\sum_{i} Z_i Z_{i+1} - g\sum_{i} X_i$$

As the transverse field coupling strength $g$ sweeps from $0.0$ to $2.5$ over 3,500 high-resolution steps, the structural expectation value smoothly decays from an absolute ferromagnetic alignment of $+1.0000$ down to $+0.0050$. This continuous trajectory maps the exact critical boundaries where quantum fluctuations dismantle long-range magnetic ordering, steering the system toward a disordered paramagnetic regime. The critical phase transition boundary is resolved via quantum susceptibility metrics at exactly **$g = 1.309$** with a maximum peak susceptibility of **$1.0000$** under zero-drift conditions.

The ansatz deploys alternating CX–RZ–CX entangling blocks across all 11 nearest-neighbor qubit pairs on a 12-qubit chain, followed by parametric RX rotations scaled to the transverse field strength ($\theta = 0.6 \cdot g$). The `<H_zz>` order parameter is computed analytically from the statevector probability distribution via bitwise parity extraction.

### 2. Quantum Error Mitigation via Real Stochastic Richardson Extrapolation (ZNE)

To circumvent non-unitary noise without physical hardware overhead, a classical-quantum hybrid mitigation protocol was deployed under a realistic stochastic Pauli-Z dephasing Kraus channel. By scaling the noise density via stretching coefficients ($\lambda_1 = 1.0, \lambda_2 = 2.0$) over $2,000$ discrete hardware shots, a linear Richardson extrapolation was computed:

$$E(0) = 2E(\lambda_1) - E(\lambda_2)$$

The protocol operates on Bloch wavevector states $|\psi(k)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_q e^{iqk} |1_q\rangle$ injected over 25 k-points spanning the full Brillouin zone $[-\pi, \pi]$. The base dephasing probability per qubit is $p = 0.06 \cdot \lambda$, applied stochastically via per-shot Kraus channel sampling with controlled seeds.

The ZNE protocol successfully reconstructed the unperturbed, zero-noise ideal target trajectory, forcing the corrupted noisy minimum at $k=0$ (degraded up to $-3.3155\text{ eV}$) back to its true analytic target value of **$-4.2467\text{ eV}$** without introducing non-linear artifacts.

### 3. Numerical Finite-Difference Gradient Mapping (VQE Energy Landscape)

A brute-force numerical gradient sweep over the full VQE variational energy landscape was executed using a centered finite-difference scheme with step $h = 10^{-5}$ radians:

$$\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta} \approx \frac{E(\theta + h) - E(\theta - h)}{2h}$$

The ansatz uses Givens rotation excitation-preserving blocks (CX–RY–CX–RY–CX chains) initialized from a single-excitation Fock state $|100000\rangle$, preserving strict particle-number conservation throughout. 3,500 continuous $\theta$ values spanning $[0, 2\pi]$ are evaluated over a 6-qubit tight-binding Hamiltonian with $t_{hopping} = 2.11$ eV.

The gradient landscape confirms the exact analytic minimum bound at:

$$E_{ground} = -2 \cdot t_{hopping} = -4.22 \text{ eV}$$

with all stationary points and gradient zero-crossings fully resolved, and no vanishing gradient plateaus present under the compact excitation-preserving ansatz.

> **Note:** This script (`vqe_gradient.py`) uses classical finite-difference differentiation. For exact quantum-native analytical gradients via Parameter-Shift Rule, see Section 6 (`vqe_jax_grad.py`).

#### 3b. Closed Form: E(θ) Without Simulating a Circuit at All

This ansatz shares one $\theta$ across every bond instead of the independent per-bond angles of Section 9c/9d — so instead of landing anywhere on the single-excitation manifold, sweeping $\theta$ traces one 1-parameter curve through it. That curve has a closed form, using the same amplitude-cascade recursion behind Section 9d's discovery:

$$c_0(\theta) = \cos^{N-1}(\theta), \qquad c_q(\theta) = \sin(\theta)\cos^{N-1-q}(\theta) \quad (q=1,\ldots,N-1)$$

`calcola_energia_vqe`'s kinetic sum is **periodic** ($q_{\text{next}} = (q+1) \bmod N$, all $N=6$ bonds including the wraparound $5\to0$ — not the $N{-}1$ open-chain bonds used by the molecular PEC scripts), giving:

$$E(\theta) = -2\,t_{hopping}\sum_{q=0}^{N-1} c_q(\theta)\, c_{(q+1)\bmod N}(\theta)$$

Verified exact (machine precision, $\sim 10^{-15}$) against `calcola_energia_vqe` across the full sweep, including at the printed checkpoints — e.g. $\theta=0.4471\text{ rad} \to E=-3.9489\text{ eV}$, gradient $-8.440000$ at $\theta=0$ — with **no circuit simulation** needed to evaluate it, `scripts/vqe_gradient.py`'s `energia_forma_chiusa()`. `tests/test_integration_smoke.py::test_vqe_gradient_closed_form_matches_real_circuit_exactly` checks the identity at 7 points across the range.

### 4. Parallel Quantum Defect Mapping via JAX Parallel Batching

Using the native `run_parametric_batch_jit()` engine, we mapped the isotropic resilience of an entangled state against localized dephasing noise. A 12-qubit entangled chain is prepared by uniform RY($\pi/4$) rotations followed by a full CX entangling ladder. A parametric RZ dephasing gate is injected node-by-node on the diagonal of the batch parameter grid, resulting in 12 concurrent independent execution tracks compiled in a single JAX XLA macro-cycle.

The evaluation maps the systematic loss of $\langle X \rangle$ single-qubit coherence:

$$\langle X_q \rangle = \text{Re}\left[\sum_i \psi_i^* \psi_{i \oplus 2^q}\right]$$

> **Correction 1 (audit finding, dense-evolution 8.1.21):** `run_parametric_batch_jit()` assigns one `parameter_batch` column per rotation gate *in the order the gates appear*, even when a gate is given a literal float instead of a string placeholder — the literal is silently discarded. The batch grid used to have only 12 columns while the circuit has 24 rotation slots (12 fixed RY(π/4) + 12 varying RZ), so the RY gates absorbed the intended RZ values and the true RZ columns ran out of bounds (silently clipped by JAX instead of raising). Fixed by supplying all 24 slots explicitly.
>
> **Correction 2 (found the same day, while trying to explain Correction 1's numbers):** `DenseSVSimulator` uses MSB-first indexing internally ($\text{phys} = N_Q{-}1{-}\text{qubit}$, see `_cx_numpy`/`apply_cx` in `dense_evolution/simulator.py`) — gate-qubit $q$ lives at physical array bit $N_Q{-}1{-}q$. The script's coherence measurement used `1 << local_qubit` directly on the *gate*-qubit index, reading a **different physical qubit** than the one that actually received that row's dephasing. The "70.71% / 50% / 43.88%" pattern originally reported here (and the "interplay between the RY layer and the CX ladder" explanation) was this indexing artifact, not real physics.

With both fixed, the true pattern is much simpler: **11 of the 12 nodes give an identical residual coherence, $43.88\%$**, and only the very last node in the chain differs, at $62.05\%$. We don't have a fully derived analytic explanation for *why* exactly one node is different (an attempted derivation via "the CNOT control's coherence is preserved" turned out to rest on a false premise — that invariance holds for Z-basis populations, not X-basis coherence — so it's reported here as a verified empirical fact, not a proven mechanism).

### 5. Rigorous 1D Crystalline Lattice Dispersion

We resolved the exact 1-electron fermionic Bloch state dispersion relation mapped via Jordan-Wigner transformations. By evaluating the pure exchange interactions ($\langle X_i X_{i+1} + Y_i Y_{i+1} \rangle$) and applying strict periodic boundary conditions (PBC), the engine resolves the full, continuous single-band cosine energy spectrum:

$$E(k) = -2t \cos(k)$$

This eliminates artificial scaling factors and rigid offsets, delivering an honest statevector simulation of tight-binding quantum dynamics under strict 1-fermion subspace conservation. The Bloch states are analytically constructed as $|\psi(k)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_q e^{iqk} |1_q\rangle$ over 8 qubits, with the kinetic energy expectation evaluated via tensor-product bitwise XY-operator matrix elements.

### 6. Analytical Gradients via Parallel Parameter-Shift Rule

> **Correction (audit finding, dense-evolution 8.1.21):** the original implementation shifted the *shared* variational parameter $t$ by $\pm\pi/2$ and read the resulting energies straight off the batch. The textbook Parameter-Shift Rule is only exact when a **single gate's own parameter** is shifted while every other gate is held fixed — here each bond applies *two* `ry` gates both driven by $t$ (`param_vqe = t`, `param_vqe_inv = -t`), so the shared-shift reading conflated their contributions. Verified against an independent finite-difference reference: the old heuristic could disagree with the true $dE/dt$ by 100%, including the wrong sign.

The corrected, mathematically exact gradient follows from the chain rule over every gate parameter individually:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum_{q} \left[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta_{A,q}} \cdot \frac{d\theta_{A,q}}{dt} + \frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta_{B,q}} \cdot \frac{d\theta_{B,q}}{dt} \right], \qquad \frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta} = \frac{1}{2}\left[E(\theta+\tfrac{\pi}{2}) - E(\theta-\tfrac{\pi}{2})\right]$$

where each $\partial E/\partial \theta$ is a genuine single-gate Parameter-Shift Rule evaluation (only that one gate shifted, all 21 others held at their base value), and $d\theta_A/dt = 1$, $d\theta_B/dt = -1$ are the known chain-rule coefficients. Verified against finite differences: agreement to $\sim 10^{-9}$, limited by finite-difference truncation rather than by the PSR itself.

By packing every shifted configuration concurrently into `run_parametric_batch_jit()`, JAX XLA processed **73,500 continuous configurations** (3,500 $\theta$ values $\times$ 21 tracks each: 1 center point + 2 shifts $\times$ 10 gate parameters) in a single chunked macro-batch execution completed in **570 seconds** on CPU — substantially more expensive than the old (incorrect) shortcut, since an exact gradient over a shared parameter genuinely requires one PSR evaluation per gate it drives, not one shift of the shared variable.

The exact quantum derivatives successfully map continuous trajectories, verifying the total absence of vanishing gradient dead-zones or artificial plateaus under compact excitation-conserving ansatze.

### 7. Strained Silicon Bandstructure Engineering (3,500-Point Sweep)

We modeled a continuous dispersion profile mapping a high-mobility Strained Silicon configuration under a $5\%$ tensile strain ($\varepsilon = 0.05$). By perturbing the atomic equilibrium distances, the physical Hamiltonian undergoes an exponential inter-orbital hopping decay dictated by Harrison's law:

$$t(\varepsilon) = \frac{t_0}{(1 + \varepsilon)^2}$$

The high-resolution 3,500-point k-space parameter sweep executed via JAX maps the physical contraction of the modal hopping energy from the standard $\pm 4.2200\text{ eV}$ limits down to the accurate engineered boundary of **$\pm 3.8277\text{ eV}$** across the Brillouin zone. The simulation uses 8-qubit fermionic Bloch states with Jordan-Wigner XY exchange operators evaluated over all 8 bonds under periodic boundary conditions.

### 8. Quantum Lattice Thermodynamics: Phonon Scattering & Decoherence

A quantum-statistical simulation of electron-phonon scattering decoherence was executed over a 10–400 K temperature sweep at 3,500 discrete points, modeling the thermal degradation of coherent electronic hopping in a silicon lattice.

The Debye-Bose-Einstein phonon occupancy is computed as:

$$\bar{n}(\omega, T) = \frac{1}{\exp\!\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_B T}\right) - 1}$$

with $\hbar\omega = 32\text{ meV}$ (silicon optical phonon branch). The effective hopping integral degrades with phonon bath population according to:

$$t_{\text{eff}}(T) = t_0 \left(1 - 0.15 \cdot \bar{n}(\omega, T)\right)$$

This captures the physical mechanism by which thermally-activated phonon scattering reduces long-range electronic coherence. A fixed Bloch state $|\psi(k = \pi/4)\rangle$ is used as the probe state on 8 qubits; the coherent kinetic energy $E(k, T)$ is evaluated via XY-operator matrix elements at each temperature step, tracking the monotonic energy suppression from cryogenic to room temperature.

### 9. Molecular VQE and Potential Energy Dissociation Curves

We mapped the exact Born-Oppenheimer Potential Energy Curve (PEC) for a silicon dimer system via a classical-quantum hybrid variational loop. The effective Hamiltonian tracks electronic hopping integrals $t(R)$ alongside nuclear Coulomb repulsion fields $V_{rep}(R)$ decaying over the interatomic coordinate:

$$t(R) = t_0 \, e^{-\beta(R - R_0)}, \qquad V_{rep}(R) = V_0 \, e^{-\gamma(R - R_0)}$$

with $t_0 = 2.11$ eV, $\beta = 1.5$ Å$^{-1}$, $R_0 = 2.35$ Å, $V_0 = 5.4$ eV, $\gamma = 3.0$ Å$^{-1}$. The ansatz is a 6-qubit excitation-preserving Givens circuit initialized from the single-fermion Fock state $|100000\rangle$, with a fixed variational angle $\theta = 0.38$ rad.

#### 9b. Adam-Optimized PEC with the Exact Chain-Rule Gradient

`vqe_silicon_molecular_optimized.py` replaces the fixed $\theta = 0.38$ with a real per-$R$ Adam optimization, using the same exact chain-rule Parameter-Shift Rule gradient validated in Section 6 (agreement with finite differences to $\sim 10^{-9}$). All $R$ points are optimized in parallel — every Adam epoch batches every $R$'s current $\theta$ into a single `run_parametric_batch_jit()` call, rather than looping epochs inside a per-$R$ loop.

The result is a genuine physical insight, not just a better number: $E(R,\theta) = -\frac{t(R)}{2}\,K(\theta) + V_{rep}(R)$, where $K(\theta)$ is the ansatz's kinetic term. Since $t(R) > 0$ everywhere and $V_{rep}(R)$ doesn't depend on $\theta$, the location of the energy minimum over $\theta$ — $\arg\max_\theta K(\theta)$ — **does not depend on $R$ at all**. Optimizing independently at 200 $R$ points converges to the same $\theta^\star \approx 0.613$ rad everywhere (confirmed against an independent fine-grained scan of $K(\theta)$, whose true maximum sits at $\theta = 0.6129$), not a curve. This is a property of the model (the $R$-dependence enters only as a positive multiplicative prefactor on a $\theta$-only kinetic term), not a bug in the optimizer.

Because $\theta = 0.38$ was not that optimum, using the correct $\theta^\star$ deepens the binding well substantially: the global minimum moves from $-0.302\text{ eV}$ at $R \approx 3.32\text{ Å}$ (fixed $\theta$) to $-0.4615\text{ eV}$ at $R \approx 3.17\text{ Å}$ (optimized), an improvement that grows to over $3\text{ eV}$ at short range where the kinetic term dominates.

The 3,500-point variational sweep over $R \in [1.2, 4.5]$ Å cleanly resolves the stable binding landscape, isolating the exact molecular equilibrium bond length and asymptotic dissociation limits without numerical instabilities.

#### 9c. Per-Bond Optimized PEC — 5 Independent Givens Angles

`vqe_silicon_molecular_optimized_per_bond.py` asks a sharper question: Section 9b's shared $\theta$ is $R$-independent *by construction*, since $R$ only ever enters as a scalar prefactor on a $\theta$-only kinetic term — true no matter how that single $\theta$ is chosen. A genuinely richer test is whether a **multi-parameter** ansatz (one independent Givens angle $\theta_q$ per bond, $q=0..4$, same particle-number-conserving structure) settles on a uniform value across bonds, or differentiates.

It differentiates, and cleanly: the 5 bonds converge to $\theta_0,...,\theta_4 \approx 0.234, 0.439, 0.632, 0.818, 1.024$ rad — an almost perfectly even $\approx 0.2$ rad spacing, not noise. This value set is itself still $R$-independent (same underlying reason as 9b — the argmax of a multi-variable $K(\vec\theta)$ under a positive scalar prefactor doesn't move with $R$ either), but it is **not** the "all bonds equal" point: the shared-$\theta$ ansatz was leaving real variational power on the table by forcing symmetry across bonds that the true optimum doesn't have. The minimum deepens further, from $-0.4615\text{ eV}$ (shared, optimized) to $-0.6685\text{ eV}$ (per-bond, optimized).

#### 9d. Closed Form: the Optimizer Rediscovers the Tight-Binding Ground State

Section 9c's near-even $\approx 0.2$ rad spacing between bond angles isn't the real story — it's a side effect of *what* the optimizer actually converges to. The sequential Givens-rotation ansatz (CX–RY–CX–RY–CX per bond, starting from $|100\ldots0\rangle$) can prepare **any** normalized single-excitation state exactly — it's a universal staircase state-preparation circuit for that Hilbert-space sector. So maximizing the total hopping energy $K(\vec\theta)$ over this ansatz is *unconstrained*: it finds the true maximum of $K$ over every possible single-excitation state, which is exactly the top-eigenvalue problem of an open tight-binding chain — the same math as a **particle in a box**. The optimizer, with no physics told to it beyond "maximize this energy," rediscovers the box's ground state on its own.

The amplitude at site $q$ (0-indexed, $N$ sites) settles on the first sine mode:

$$c_q \propto \sin\!\left(\frac{(q+1)\pi}{N+1}\right), \qquad K_{max} = 4\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{N+1}\right)$$

and the per-bond Givens angle that *prepares* this profile via the sequential construction has its own closed form ($r_q$ = the tail norm $\sqrt{\sum_{k=q}^{N-1} c_k^2}$):

$$\theta_q = \arcsin\!\left(\frac{c_q}{r_q}\right)$$

No optimizer needed: plugging this formula directly into the circuit reproduces the numerically Adam-optimized result to **machine precision** ($\sim 10^{-15}$), and holds for every chain length tested (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 qubits) — not a coincidence specific to this 6-qubit example. `scripts/vqe_silicon_molecular_optimized_per_bond.py` implements this as `theta_ground_state_closed_form()` / `kinetic_max_closed_form()`, and `tests/test_vqe_molecular_per_bond.py` verifies the identity exactly (`test_closed_form_ground_state_matches_script_kinetic_maximum`, `test_closed_form_generalizes_across_chain_lengths`).

#### 9e. Extreme/Irregular Geometry Benchmark — When Does a Rigid Shared Angle Actually Fail?

Sections 9-9d all sweep one interatomic distance $R$ shared by the whole chain. `vqe_extreme_geometries.py` breaks that symmetry: each of the 5 bonds gets its own distance $R_q$, modeling an irregular or distorted chain (extreme compression, near-dissociation stretch, a localized "mutated" bond, or several at once) instead of a smooth uniform-$R$ sweep. Hopping $t_q(R_q)$ stays strictly local (bond-by-bond), while the steric/electrostatic repulsion keeps Section 9's exact single-formula shape, evaluated at the geometry's mean bond length — so the model collapses **exactly** onto Section 9's original scalar energy in the uniform-$R$, uniform-$\theta$ limit (`tests/test_vqe_extreme_geometries.py::test_energy_matches_reference_scalar_formula_for_uniform_geometry`).

A naive comparison against the fixed $\theta=0.38$ baseline is scale-confounded: every uniform-$R$ geometry already shows a large "improvement" from per-bond optimization, purely because the per-bond ansatz can reach the true sine-mode kinetic maximum (Section 9d) that a single shared angle structurally cannot — regardless of whether the geometry is "extreme." The metric that actually isolates the effect of geometry *irregularity* is scale-normalized:

$$\text{deficit\_fraction} = \frac{K_{\text{per-bond}}^{\star} - K_{\text{shared}}^{\star}}{K_{\text{per-bond}}^{\star}}$$

comparing per-bond adaptive optimization against the **best achievable single shared angle** — re-optimized per geometry, not the fixed $0.38$ — which cancels the overall $t(R)$ energy scale (verified scale-invariant across uniform geometries to $< 5\times10^{-3}$).

Across 6 hand-picked scenarios, the result is not "any distortion is worse":

| Scenario | `deficit_fraction` |
|---|---|
| Uniform equilibrium / compressed / dissociated | $0.169$ (identical across all three — scale-invariant) |
| Single localized mutated bond | $0.103$ (**below** the uniform baseline) |
| Alternating compressed/stretched pattern | $0.027$ (**below** the uniform baseline) |
| Two mutated bonds at opposite chain ends | $\mathbf{0.500}$ (nearly 3$\times$ the uniform baseline) |

A single shared angle is not simply "worse under any distortion" — it specifically struggles when the geometry forces it to reconcile two strongly-weighted but topologically distant bonds (opposite ends of the chain) at once, something one scalar parameter cannot do but per-bond adaptation can. This is a tight-binding / single-excitation hopping toy model, not ab-initio electronic structure: "rigid angle fails" here means concretely that a single shared $\theta$ cannot simultaneously satisfy 5 different per-bond stationarity conditions once the $R_q$ differ, leaving variational energy on the table that per-bond optimization recovers — nothing here claims to model real electron correlation or nuclear quantum repulsion.

[![Extreme/Irregular Geometry Benchmark](https://github.com/tatopenn-cell/Dense-Evolution-Discovery/releases/download/v2.1.0/vqe_extreme_geometries.png)](https://github.com/tatopenn-cell/Dense-Evolution-Discovery/releases/download/v2.1.0/vqe_extreme_geometries.png)

#### 9f. Deeper Ansatz (12 Parameters) + a Genuine Minimum-Energy Conformational Search

`vqe_extreme_geometries_deep.py` generalizes Section 9e's benchmark from $N_Q=6$ (5 bonds, 10 parameters) to $N_Q=7$ (6 bonds, 12 parameters) — the same model, one more bond in the chain, everything already parametric in $N_Q$. The qualitative `deficit_fraction` pattern does **not** carry over unchanged: at 12 parameters, `mutazione_localizzata` (0.188) and `distorsione_alternata` (0.264) now sit *above* the uniform baseline (0.163), whereas at 10 parameters both sat *below* it (0.103 / 0.027 vs. 0.169). Only `mutazioni_congiunte_estremi` is a robust standout across both depths (0.464 at 12 parameters vs. 0.500 at 10 — still, by far, the worst case).

[![12-Parameter Extreme-Geometry Benchmark](https://github.com/tatopenn-cell/Dense-Evolution-Discovery/releases/download/v2.2.0/vqe_extreme_geometries_deep.png)](https://github.com/tatopenn-cell/Dense-Evolution-Discovery/releases/download/v2.2.0/vqe_extreme_geometries_deep.png)

Beyond the hand-picked geometries, `optimize_geometry_and_theta_jointly()` searches for a genuine minimum-energy conformation by optimizing the bond distances $R_q$ *jointly* with the per-bond angles (classical analytic gradient for $R$ — it only enters through $t_q(R_q)$ and the repulsion term, no PSR needed). This required a **per-bond** repulsion term, not the mean-based one used by the fixed-geometry benchmark above: under free $R$ optimization, mean-based repulsion dilutes the repulsive cost by $1/N_{\text{bonds}}$, letting a single bond collapse almost without limit — caught during development when every tested starting point drove one bond straight to an artificial clip boundary with a suspiciously large negative energy. With per-bond repulsion (every bond gets its own local repulsive wall), three different starting geometries converge to distinct, physically reasonable conformations ($R^\star$ in the 3.4–5.3 Å range, no boundary artifacts), with energies $-0.171$ / $-0.153$ / $-0.052$ eV — suggesting genuinely different local minima depending on the starting geometry, not full global convergence at the epoch budget used (reported honestly, not oversold).

## 🔍 Additional Investigation: Hunting Quantum Many-Body Scars

`scripts/quantum_scar_investigation/` contains a self-contained, honestly-reported investigation into whether a "quantum many-body scar" (the non-thermalizing phenomenon first observed in 2017 Rydberg-atom experiments) shows up in Dense Evolution's frustrated Ising simulations. Full writeup: [`report_indagine_scar.md`](scripts/quantum_scar_investigation/report_indagine_scar.md) (Italian).

**Short version**: an initial-looking scar signature on a 4x4 frustrated TFIM grid did **not** survive rigorous verification (entanglement entropy, Trotter convergence, and a systematic 25-combination parameter scan) — it turned out to be the wrong observable (energy instead of entanglement entropy) plus a gauge-equivalence coincidence between sign patterns. The verification pipeline was then validated against the PXP model (Rydberg blockade), where scars are known to genuinely exist — confirmed via fidelity revivals and the characteristic "tower" of low-entanglement eigenstates in the exact spectrum. Using Dense Evolution's own `NoiseModel.apply_to_sv` (real stochastic Kraus channel, averaged over 30 quantum trajectories), the PXP scars turned out to be extremely fragile: **a 0.5-1% per-site depolarizing error rate destroys almost the entire revival signal.** Projecting the noisy state back onto the exact 13-state scar tower recovers ~31x of the lost revival amplitude — an idealized theoretical bound (not a realizable hardware protocol as-is) showing the protection target exists.

Open for anyone who wants to pick it up: translating the PXP dynamics into an actual circuit and testing revival + a physically realizable protection protocol (e.g. constraint-postselection instead of exact-eigenstate projection) on real quantum hardware.

### 10. Automated CI Cross-Validation (Dense Evolution vs. PennyLane)

To guarantee the mathematical stability and absolute physical accuracy of the simulated quantum dynamics, the repository includes a strict continuous integration (CI) pipeline executed via GitHub Actions (`ci.yml`). 

The test suite (`test_pennylane_comparison.py`) establishes an automated cross-validation layer by mirroring the statevector computations on two completely independent software architectures:
- **Target Simulator:** Dense Evolution (v8.1.21) accelerated via JAX XLA.
- **Baseline Reference:** PennyLane.

The pipeline runs on every code splotch or pull request, evaluating the numerical consistency of the 1D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) expectation values, variational gradients, and Bloch state rotations. By testing the outputs across both engines, the CI automatically flags floating-point drift or algebraic regressions exceeding machine-epsilon tolerances.

---
### 11. Zero-Dependency Analytical Validation Suite

To ensure absolute core-level stability without relying on third-party frameworks, the repository features a dedicated self-contained validation layer (`test_analytical.py`). This suite runs directly against exact mathematical identities and physics boundaries under machine-precision tolerances ($\le 10^{-10}$), keeping execution times strictly below 20 seconds on standard GitHub Actions CPU runners.

The suite enforces verification across five distinct physical and algorithmic benchmarks:

1. **Potential Energy Curve (PEC) Topography (`test_pec_shape`)**: Validates the qualitative Born-Oppenheimer energy landscape of molecular Silicon systems. It guarantees that the simulation resolves the correct three-region behavior: a steep repulsive wall at short range ($R = 1.4\text{ Å}, E > 0$), a stable binding well at intermediate distance ($R = 3.3\text{ Å}, E < 0$), and asymptotic stabilization near the dissociation limit ($R = 7.0\text{ Å}, |E| < 0.01\text{ eV}$).
2. **Bound-State Existence (`test_pec_minimum_is_negative`)**: Scans the well core ($R \in [3.0, 4.5]\text{ Å}$, empirically confirmed bound at every sampled point) and asserts $E < -0.01\text{ eV}$ at each one, proving a genuine stable ground state rather than merely finite output — tightened during the dense-evolution 8.1.21 audit, when this test was found asserting only `np.isfinite` despite its docstring's stronger claim.
3. **Exact Parameter-Shift Rule (`test_psr_exactness_ry_z`)**: Mathematically benchmarks the single-gate PSR primitive underlying the VQE gradient engine (`vqe_jax_grad.py`). By tracking an $RY(\theta)|0\rangle$ state followed by a $\langle Z \rangle$ measurement, it verifies that the computed gradient perfectly mirrors the exact analytical identity $\frac{dE}{d\theta} = -\sin(\theta)$. `tests/test_vqe_jax_gradient.py` extends this same exactness check to the full multi-gate, chain-rule PSR gradient used in production.
4. **Harrison's Hopping Law (`test_harrison_strain_ratio`)**: Verifies the bandstructure deformation engine under mechanical stress (`next_gen_silicon.py`). It enforces that the exact ratio of strained to unstrained tight-binding energies follows Harrison's solid-state scaling law, $t(\varepsilon) = \frac{t_0}{(1+\varepsilon)^2}$, at every non-trivial $k$-point across the Brillouin zone.
5. **Time-Reversal Dispersion Symmetry (`test_dispersion_time_reversal_symmetry`)**: Checks the underlying algebraic symmetry of the tight-binding Bloch states, ensuring that the dispersion relation satisfies the strict time-reversal constraint $E(k) \equiv E(-k)$ to isolate and prevent unphysical symmetry-breaking artifacts.

### 12. ZNE-Before-PSR: Correcting Each Gradient Term Before the Chain Rule, Not After

Every gradient in this repo is computed via the exact Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR): shift a single gate's own parameter by $\pm\pi/2$, held fixed against every other gate, and take $\frac{1}{2}[E(\theta+\tfrac{\pi}{2}) - E(\theta-\tfrac{\pi}{2})]$ (Section 6). `zne_stabilized_psr_gradient.py` asks what happens to that gradient under a real stochastic noise channel (`dense_evolution.registry.NoiseModel.apply_to_sv`, always applied post-hoc to an already-computed clean statevector — verified by reading the simulator's source in full, no noise anywhere in the unitary simulation path itself): does correcting each individual single-gate shifted evaluation with Zero-Noise Extrapolation — the same static 2-point Richardson formula already validated in Section 2, $E_{\text{zne}} = 2E(\lambda{=}1) - E(\lambda{=}2)$ — **before** combining them via the chain rule, stabilize the resulting gradient?

> **Correction (found during development):** an early version of this script shifted the shared *scalar* $\theta$ by $\pm\pi/2$ directly inside the circuit — exactly the mistake already documented and fixed in Section 6. A finite-difference test caught it immediately (a completely different gradient, wrong magnitude *and* sign region). Fixed by shifting each of the $2\times5=10$ individual gate parameters one at a time and recombining via the chain rule, exactly as Section 6 already does.

The honest finding is **not** what a naive "ZNE = more stable" intuition predicts, and is not uniform across $\theta$ either (40 trials, 200 shots, measured RMSE against the exact gradient):

| $\theta$ | exact | naive RMSE | ZNE-pre-PSR RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.20 | +7.354 | 3.118 | 1.394 |
| 0.38 | +5.071 | 2.167 | 1.041 |
| 0.62 | −0.127 | 0.115 | 0.261 |
| 1.00 | −3.323 | 1.414 | 0.716 |

Away from a gradient zero-crossing ($\theta=0.20, 0.38, 1.00$), ZNE-pre-PSR cuts bias roughly in half to a third and — despite *increasing* the trial-to-trial standard deviation by roughly 2x (the textbook Richardson bias/variance tradeoff: $2E_1-E_2$ amplifies statistical noise in exchange for cancelling the leading systematic error) — nets a clearly lower RMSE, roughly 2–2.2x better. But at $\theta=0.62$, where the exact gradient is itself near zero, ZNE-pre-PSR is worse on **every** axis: there is very little systematic bias left to correct, so Richardson's variance amplification just adds noise. "ZNE stabilizes the gradient" is therefore a regime-dependent claim, not a universal property of ZNE-pre-PSR.

### 13. Adaptive ZNE-Before-PSR via Predictive Healing — An Honest Negative Result

Section 12's static correction actively *hurts* near a gradient zero-crossing ($\theta=0.62$). `zne_adaptive_psr_gradient.py` asks whether **attenuating** the correction when per-shift confidence is low — via `dense_evolution.healing.calculate_delta_preemp`, previously only prototyped against a synthetic "coherence" proxy in scratch code, here fed a **real, measured** standard error of the mean (SEM) of each shifted evaluation — can recover $\theta=0.62$ without giving up Section 12's wins elsewhere.

**It does not.** No `(target_sigma_ideal, k_sensitivity)` calibration explored Pareto-dominates; the shipped default is a documented compromise point, not a solution. At full budget (40 trials, 200 shots), the adaptive correction sits strictly **between** naive and static at every tested $\theta$ and never wins outright anywhere:

| $\theta$ | naive RMSE | static RMSE | adaptive RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.20 | 3.131 | 1.425 | 2.501 |
| 0.38 | 2.180 | 0.961 | 2.170 |
| 0.62 | 0.106 | 0.248 | 0.175 |
| 1.00 | 1.406 | 0.684 | 1.139 |

**Root cause:** the measured SEM sits in the same narrow band ($\sim 0.016$–$0.025$) regardless of $\theta$ — it's driven by shot count and the noise probability, not by proximity to a gradient zero-crossing, so it carries no information about the quantity that actually determines whether Richardson correction helps or hurts (the size of the systematic bias being corrected, relative to noise). A single scalar SEM threshold can't distinguish "large bias, correction pays off" from "near-zero bias, correction just adds noise." A more promising unexplored direction: a confidence signal built from the correction term's own signal-to-noise ratio ($|E_1-E_2|$ relative to their combined SEM), rather than the noise of a single measurement in isolation.

This negative result is reported in full because, done rigorously, it carries the same scientific value as a positive one: it saves the next person from re-walking this exact path.

### 14. A Second Adaptive-ZNE Attempt via the Correction Term's Own SNR — Hypothesis Rejected

Section 13's SEM-based confidence signal failed because SEM doesn't correlate with proximity to a gradient zero-crossing. `zne_snr_adaptive_psr_gradient.py` tries the more principled signal flagged there: the correction term's own signal-to-noise ratio, $|E_1-E_2|$ relative to their combined standard error, reusing `calculate_delta_preemp` honestly via a clamp so confidence correctly *grows* with SNR (the opposite direction from Section 13's SEM case).

**Hypothesis rejected again, with a more interesting failure mode.** At the calibrated default ($\text{SNR}_{\text{target}}=3.0$, 40 trials, 200 shots):

| $\theta$ | naive RMSE | static RMSE | SNR-adaptive RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.20 | 3.151 | 1.380 | 1.421 |
| 0.38 | 2.178 | 0.920 | **0.862 (beats static)** |
| 0.62 | 0.107 | 0.263 | **0.307 (regresses)** |
| 1.00 | 1.427 | 0.673 | 0.665 |

At $\theta=0.38$ the correction beats the static one outright — something Section 13's SEM-based model never achieved anywhere. But at $\theta=0.62$, the exact case this was meant to fix, it makes things *worse* instead of better. Raising $\text{SNR}_{\text{target}}$ to 6.0 does not selectively fix that case either — it makes every $\theta$ worse, disproving the "a higher threshold isolates the zero-crossing" hypothesis: the algorithm is hyper-sensitive to this one calibration knob, not robust to it.

**Root cause:** SNR here is computed from a difference between two *noise scales* at the same gate-shift ($E_1$ at $p$, $E_2$ at $2p$). The PSR gradient's zero-crossing comes from a near-cancellation between two *gate-shifts* at the same noise scale ($E_{+\pi/2} - E_{-\pi/2}$). These are independent quantities with no causal link — and $|E_1-E_2|$ is itself a biased estimator with a noise floor (its expectation doesn't vanish even when the true difference does), which is why SNR measured a misleadingly high $\sim 3.3$–$6.6$ at *every* tested $\theta$, including 0.62. Development on this direction is halted; future adaptive-ZNE work returns to refining Section 13's SEM-based model, which specifically improved on static at the critical $\theta=0.62$ case, something this attempt did not reproduce.

> **Correction (reproducibility bug found during this study):** Python's built-in `hash()` is not stable across process invocations for tuples containing strings (hash randomization on by default) — the `hash((tag, theta, trial)) % 2**32` seeding pattern used for trial data in this study and in Sections 12–13 silently drew different noise realizations on every run despite looking deterministic. A test asserting a specific RMSE comparison passed once and failed on an immediate re-run as a direct result. Fixed with `zlib.crc32`-based stable seeding across all three ZNE-PSR studies; verified identical results across two separate process invocations after the fix. None of the reported findings above changed as a result — only the seeding mechanism did.

### 15. Sophia Reflection: A Real ZNE Trajectory, Not an Invented One

`scripts/sophia_reflection.py` runs the density-matrix extension of ZNE (`dense_evolution.mitigation.zne_density_matrix`/`uhlmann_fidelity` — the matrix-valued form, distinct from the scalar Richardson protocol Section 2 above hand-rolls) across a 16-point depolarizing-noise sweep on a 2-qubit Bell state. All 16 points improve fidelity (mean delta +0.182, range [+0.025, +0.366]); the gain isn't monotonic in noise strength — it grows through the low-to-mid range, peaks around $p\approx0.21$, then tapers as extrapolation itself gets less reliable at high noise, consistent with the Richardson-noise-amplification finding already documented in dense-evolution's own changelog.

This one has a second half. It's a direct answer to an August 2025 personal notebook that modeled subjective experience as invented Hilbert-space vectors and fed them to an LLM ("Sophia") for reflection — with real measured data instead of synthesized states, and a reflection an LLM (Claude) actually wrote after seeing this script's real output, not before. See [`SOPHIA_REFLECTION.md`](SOPHIA_REFLECTION.md) for the full trajectory and the reflection itself.

### 16. Channel-Order Non-Commutativity: An Honest Positive Result from the Same Archive

The same August-September 2025 archive that produced Sophia's origin also built up a numbered "rule book" of ~120 empirical claims about noise behavior on small quantum circuits (a "Teoria della Riorganizzazione Entropica Coerente", TREC). Batch-testing 8 of its explicit, unambiguous rules against a fair same-size GHZ baseline (same noise channels, same intensities, same statistics) found **zero** rules showing a real, un-confounded difference from generic noise physics — every claimed "structural resilience" reduced to either ordinary noise physics or a methodological artifact (e.g. a baseline that happened to include the amplitude-damping ground state itself, discovered and corrected during this same investigation).

One claim was different: that the **order** of applying two distinct noise channels leaves a measurable fingerprint — the archive's own "Attrattori Crono-Topologici" idea, claimed as a blanket rule across Regole 100-109 for *any* channel pair. `scripts/channel_order_noncommutativity.py` tests it directly on the Regola 16 circuit (`GHZ(3q) -> X(Q0) -> Z(Q1) -> X(Q2) -> CNOT(Q0,Q2)`) on two different channel pairs, same intensities (p=0.3 each), 8192 Monte Carlo trajectories per order:

- **dephasing → amplitude damping vs. the reverse: real, not noise.** State `|000⟩` lands at 17.4% under dephasing→AD vs. 13.3% under AD→dephasing. Jensen-Shannon divergence 0.00174 against a permutation null topping out at 0.00054 (p=0.0033).
- **dephasing → bit-flip vs. the reverse: no signal.** Jensen-Shannon divergence 0.00027, well inside the permutation null (p=0.24).

The dividing line isn't "any two channels" — it's **Pauli vs. non-Pauli**. Phaseflip and bit-flip are both Pauli channels, and Pauli channels commute with each other as superoperators (they're simultaneously diagonal in the Pauli-transfer-matrix basis), so their order genuinely doesn't matter. Amplitude damping is non-unital — it has a preferred fixed point, `|0⟩` — and isn't a Pauli channel, which is exactly why composing it with a Pauli channel *is* order-dependent. So Regole 100-109's blanket "order always matters" is an overgeneralization from one true instance: the precise, verified rule is that channel order matters **iff at least one of the two channels is non-Pauli**. Quantum channels genuinely don't commute in general, but not universally either — this is the one claim from the whole archive that survived contact with a fair, statistically rigorous test, refined into its correct, narrower form.

### 17. Loschmidt Echo and Zero-Noise Extrapolation

In a closed quantum system, evolving forward in time under a chaotic unitary $U$ and then backward under $U^{-1}$ reconstructs the initial state exactly ($F=1.0$). Coupling to an environment along the way breaks that time-reversal symmetry — the **Loschmidt echo** fidelity

$$F = \left|\langle\psi_0|\,U^{-1}\,\mathcal{N}\,U\,|\psi_0\rangle\right|^2$$

decays below 1 as noise $\mathcal{N}$ is injected mid-evolution. The model is one Trotter step of a "kicked Ising" chain:

$$U_{\text{step}} = \left(\prod_{i} \text{CX}_{i,i+1}\right)\left(\prod_i RX_i(\pi/4)\right)\left(\prod_i RZ_i(h_i)\right), \qquad h_i \sim \mathcal{U}(-2, 2)$$

— a fixed transverse "kick" ($RX$), a fresh random longitudinal disorder field per step ($RZ$), and nearest-neighbor coupling ($CX$), the standard toy model for quantum chaos. `scripts/loschmidt_echo_zne.py` runs this circuit forward for 4 steps, then its exact inverse backward ($RZ(\theta)^{-1}=RZ(-\theta)$, $RX(\theta)^{-1}=RX(-\theta)$, $CX^{-1}=CX$, gates in reverse order), with an amplitude-damping channel injected between every single layer — forward and backward — and reinjected into the simulator via `set_initial_state` so each subsequent layer acts on the actually-noisy state. A noiseless self-check ($p=0$ must return fidelity exactly $1.0$) gates the noisy results before they're trusted.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Qubits / Trotter steps | 4 / 4 |
| Kick angle ($RX$) | $\pi/4$ |
| Disorder field | $h_i \sim \mathcal{U}(-2, 2)$ rad, resampled every step, per qubit |
| Noise channel | amplitude damping, injected between every layer |
| ZNE noise scales | $1.0\lambda,\ 1.5\lambda,\ 2.0\lambda$ ($\lambda = 0.015$) |
| Monte Carlo trajectories per scale | 300 |
| **Noiseless self-check fidelity** | **1.000000000000** (exact) |
| Raw noisy return fidelity ($\lambda=1.0$) | **0.7769** |
| ZNE-corrected return fidelity | **0.9965** |
| Net fidelity gain | **+0.2195** |

### 18. Topological Mott Isolator: VQE Ground-State Optimization

The Hamiltonian is built directly on computational basis states (site $A$ = qubits $0,1$; site $B$ = qubits $2,3$):

$$H(U) = \frac{U}{2}\sum_{s\in\{A,B\}} n_s(n_s-1)\; -\; t_1\!\!\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}\!\!\left(c_i^\dagger c_j + \text{h.c.}\right)\; -\; t_2\!\!\sum_{\langle\langle i,j\rangle\rangle}\!\!\left(e^{i\phi} c_i^\dagger c_j + \text{h.c.}\right)$$

— on-site Mott repulsion $U$, nearest-neighbor hopping $t_1$, and a complex next-nearest-neighbor "Haldane phase" hopping $t_2 e^{i\phi}$. `build_tmi_hamiltonian` constructs this by touching each unordered basis-state pair exactly once and setting both conjugate entries together, so it's Hermitian by construction (`test_hamiltonian_is_hermitian`).

`scripts/vqe_tmi_material_design.py` optimizes an 8-parameter RY-CX-RZ ansatz via exact JAX autodiff (`jax.value_and_grad` straight through `circuit_to_energy_fn`) driving Adam, with 8 random restarts per Mott-repulsion value $U$ to avoid a bad local minimum, all batched into one `jax.vmap`'d update per epoch. Every result is checked against an independent reference: direct dense diagonalization of the same Hamiltonian, which fixes the true ground energy and the variational bound $E_{\text{VQE}} \geq E_{\text{exact}}$ that any correct implementation must respect.

| $U$ (eV) | Exact ground state | VQE-optimized | Unoptimized $\theta$ (random) | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | −3.3451 | −3.3451 | −0.0424 | **+0.0000** |
| 0.55 | −3.1231 | −3.0984 | −1.0628 | +0.0248 |
| 1.64 | −2.8580 | −2.7145 | +1.5875 | +0.1435 |
| 3.27 | −2.6608 | −2.3180 | +0.4666 | +0.3428 |
| 4.91 | −2.5581 | −2.0602 | +4.7166 | +0.4979 |
| 6.00 | −2.5136 | −2.0000 | +2.4801 | **+0.5136** |

The optimizer respects the bound at every single point in the full 12-point sweep (no violations) and reaches the exact ground state at $U=0$. The gap grows with $U$ — an honest ansatz-expressivity limit in the strongly-correlated regime: multi-start restarts converge to the same plateau there rather than scattering, which is what a genuine expressivity ceiling looks like, not under-training.

### 19. GaAs Parameters via DFT and Dielectric Screening

Section 18's $U$ sweep uses arbitrary units, exploring a design space rather than a specific material. Grounding $t$/$U$ in chemistry starts from a PySCF DFT calculation on a GaAs dimer (PBE/STO-3G, the Ga-As zinc-blende nearest-neighbor bond length of 2.44 Å).

Reaching a stable SCF solution:

| Stage | Method | SCF energy (Ha) | Converged? | Stable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plain CDIIS (200 cycles) | first-order DIIS | −4111.4032 | ✗ | — |
| Level-shift + ADIIS pre-step | | −4111.1869 | ✗ | — |
| Newton-Raphson (SOSCF), first attempt | seeded from the pre-step | −4111.9696 | ✓ | ✗ (saddle point, Hessian eigenvalues `[-2.37, -2.37, -2.30]`) |
| Newton-Raphson, restarted | reseeded from `mf.stability()`'s lower-energy orbitals | −4111.9696 | ✓ | ✓ (Hessian eigenvalues `[~0, +0.0108, +0.0359]`) |

The final stable point was reproduced independently from a second, differently-seeded optimization path to 6 significant figures. Along the way, a cruder diagnostic (comparing raw occupied/virtual orbital energies) flagged a "HOMO above LUMO" ordering on this same converged, stable solution; that turned out to be a known feature of Kohn-Sham DFT, where virtual orbitals see the same $N$-electron potential as occupied ones rather than an $N{+}1$-electron one, so they aren't required to sit above the HOMO the way Hartree-Fock intuition expects. The rigorous test is the stability Hessian, which passed.

The raw DFT calculation gives an on-site Coulomb integral of $38.3847$ eV — but that number describes two isolated atoms in vacuum. GaAs isn't conventionally modeled as a Hubbard material, so there's no literature $U$ to check it against directly, but a bare two-atom-in-vacuum integral is expected to overestimate a solid's actual on-site repulsion, which the surrounding crystal's dielectric response screens. Dividing by GaAs's static dielectric constant ($\varepsilon = 12.9$, Sze) gives the material parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| $t$ (hopping) | **7.9170 eV** |
| $U$ (screened) | **2.9756 eV** |
| $U/t$ | **0.376** |

$U/t = 0.376$ sits deep in the weakly-correlated regime, consistent with GaAs being a conventional band semiconductor rather than a Mott insulator — the unscreened value ($U/t=4.85$) would have implied a strongly-correlated material instead.

`scripts/vqe_tmi_material_design.py`'s `run_real_gaas_point()` runs the same VQE-vs-diagonalization pipeline from Section 18 at this point (right panel of the plot below). The variational bound holds (gap `+0.1028`).

### 20. Harrison / VHD Tight-Binding Validation Against Real Experimental Gaps

The main Dense-Evolution library's `harrison_tb.py` (Harrison's *universal* sp3 tight-binding parameters — one fixed table for every material, no per-material fitting) and `vhd_tb.py` (Vogl-Hjalmarson-Dow's *material-specific* sp3s\* parameters, 1983) are checked here against real experimental band gaps for GaAs, Si, and Ge — not toy numbers, the actual textbook values (1.42, 1.12, 0.66 eV). GaAs is direct-gap (minimum at $\Gamma$); Si and Ge are indirect-gap, with the conduction-band minimum off-$\Gamma$ (along $\Gamma \to X$ for Si, $\Gamma \to L$ for Ge) — found by scanning the relevant k-space line rather than reading only $\Gamma$.

| Material | Gap type | Harrison universal | VHD material-specific | Experimental |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaAs | direct, $\Gamma$ | 2.906 eV (**104.7%** error) | 1.55 eV (**9.2%** error) | 1.42 eV |
| Si | indirect, $\Gamma \to X$ | 3.66 eV (**227%** error, CBM misplaced at $\Gamma$) | 1.171 eV (**4.6%** error) | 1.12 eV |
| Ge | indirect, $\Gamma \to L$ | 1.831 eV (**177.5%** error, CBM misplaced at $\Gamma$) | 0.765 eV (**15.9%** error, correctly finds L below X) | 0.66 eV |

Harrison's universal parameters are qualitatively sane (Hermitian, correct bonding/antibonding structure) but consistently 2-3x off quantitatively, and structurally cannot place the conduction-band minimum correctly for indirect-gap materials — it always lands at $\Gamma$. Vogl-Hjalmarson-Dow's material-specific parameters get within 5-16% of experiment and correctly identify which off-$\Gamma$ valley is the true minimum. Neither replaces this repo's own DFT-derived GaAs parameters (Section 19) when first-principles accuracy is needed — their value is as fast, dependency-free (no PySCF/OpenFermion) estimates.

### 21. Traversable-Wormhole-Inspired Quantum Teleportation (SYK Model)

Real reproduction of the Gao-Jafferis-Wall traversable-wormhole teleportation protocol on a chaotic binary sparse N=8 Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, following **arXiv:2604.10090** — built on `dashboard_core.wormhole` (main library, `dense-evolution>=8.1.49`). An earlier, discarded circuit used the right vocabulary but wasn't real physics: a single-qubit-register readout structurally cannot show sign-dependent behavior (the no-signaling theorem forbids it), verified directly rather than assumed. The real protocol needs two coupled chaotic systems, a message injected via a separate reference-qubit pair, a real bilinear L-R coupling, and a mutual-information readout — all implemented and unit-tested in the main repo.

Instance selection matters: a random draw of which SYK terms to keep does not reliably show the signal. `select_good_instance` reproduces the paper's own criterion (screen candidates by exact commuting/anticommuting term-pair count) — seed 61 matches the paper's ratio (34 commuting / 11 anticommuting) exactly and is used throughout.

| Scan | Peak | Value |
|---|---|---|
| t1 (post-coupling evolution) | t1=0.60 | delta=+0.00468 |
| message vs. no-message control | — | I(P:R)=0 exactly without the message |
| mu (coupling strength) | mu≈11 | delta=+0.00473 |
| t0 (pre-coupling scrambling time) | t0≈0.60 | delta=+0.00972 |
| 2D joint grid (t0, mu) | t0=0.65, mu=15.0 | delta=+0.01167 |
| t1 re-scan at (t0=0.65, mu=15.0) | t1=0.41 | delta=+0.01518 |
| iterated coordinate ascent (3 rounds, converged) | t0=0.70, mu=17.0, t1=0.36 | delta=+0.01688 |
| generality check (6 SYK instances) | — | does NOT generalize |
| realistic noise robustness (Trotter, depolarizing) | p where signal crosses zero | between p=0.01 and p=0.02 |
| cross-check vs. arXiv:2604.10090's own ensemble claim (n=6) | seeds 2166, 2907 at paper defaults | 2/6 still wrong-signed |
| **large-sample ensemble sign check (n=100, matching the paper's own ensemble size)** | — | **49/100 (49%) wrong-signed** |
| size winding (arXiv:2604.10090 Sec. S6 diagnostic, 6 instances x 4 times) | max\|phase\|, min R(l) | max\|phase\|≈0, min R(l)=1.0 everywhere (no winding) |
| mechanistic check (n=100): message-mode participation / operator growth rate | — | r=-0.012 (p=0.90) / r=+0.126 (p=0.21), neither significant |
| qubit-coupling topology check (n=100): n_zero_pairs / algebraic connectivity | — | r=+0.159 (p=0.11) / r=-0.141 (p=0.16), neither significant |
| **N-scaling check (N=8 vs N=12, Trotter backend, matched)** | wrong-sign rate / mean \|delta\| | 2/6 vs 2/6 (too small to trust) / **0.00765 -> 0.00034 (~22x drop)** |
| term-order non-commutativity check (n=6 spot-check -> n=30 verified) | order_sensitivity vs. sign | r=+0.474 (p=0.34) -> **r=+0.282 (p=0.13) at n=30**, not significant |
| **term-order x noise interaction check (n=6 -> n=50, verified 4x)** | noisy_order_sensitivity vs. sign | r=+0.811 (p=0.050) -> +0.587 -> +0.396 -> **r=+0.340 (p=0.0158) at n=50**, significant at every step |

The signal requires enough pre-coupling scrambling before it appears (consistent with the protocol's theoretical chaos requirement) and vanishes exactly — not just approximately — when the message injection is removed, confirming the sign-dependent asymmetry genuinely comes from the teleported message rather than the L-R coupling alone. The 1D mu and t0 scans hold the other axis fixed, so neither alone finds the true joint optimum — a real 870-point 2D grid search resolves that, finding a broad, smooth peak at `t0=0.65, mu=15.0` that beats both 1D scans. That 2D grid itself held `t1` fixed at `0.60` (Experiment 1's own 1D peak) and flagged this as an open question — a follow-up re-scan of `t1` at the 2D optimum (126 points, step 0.01) confirms the peak does shift, to `t1=0.41`, delta=+0.01518, ~30% above the value reported with `t1` held fixed. That single re-scan was itself only one coordinate-ascent step — iterating it (alternating full t1 scans and (t0, mu) grids from Experiment 5's starting point) converges after 3 rounds to a genuine fixed point: `t0=0.70, mu=17.0, t1=0.36`, delta=+0.01688, **+44.6% over Experiment 5's original headline value**. **Four honest negative results follow.** First: repeating that exact same procedure on 5 more SYK instances that independently match the paper's own selection criterion shows this converged point does **not** generalize — the (t0, mu, t1) answers scatter across nearly the whole scanned range instead of clustering. Second: even at seed=61's own best point, a real Trotterized gate circuit with a stochastic depolarizing channel injected after each protocol phase shows the sign-dependent signal decaying with noise and **crossing zero between p=0.01 and p=0.02** — well within range of current real NISQ hardware. Third: arXiv:2604.10090's own "Ensemble robustness" section claims (from 100 disorder realizations) that the sign-dependent asymmetry is "a generic feature of the ensemble". Re-evaluating 6 of our 34/11-matched instances at the paper's own stated default parameters (`t0=0.3, mu=12, t1=0.60`) leaves 2 of 6 wrong-signed. Fourth, and strongest: **scaling that same check to n=100 instances (matching the paper's own reported ensemble size) finds 49/100 (49%) wrong-signed — essentially a coin flip, not a "generic feature of the ensemble".** Two candidate structural explanations for the sign variation (Majorana mode-usage imbalance in the coupling terms; the spectral level-spacing r-statistic, a standard chaos diagnostic) were tested for real correlation at n=100 — neither holds up (mode-usage: r=0.171, p=0.09; level-spacing: r=0.087, p=0.39; an earlier n=6 look had suggested mode-usage imbalance correlated strongly, r=0.87, which does *not* replicate at n=100 -- an honest correction of that small-sample impression). **A third, theory-motivated diagnostic — the paper's own "size winding" formalism (Sec. S6, Eqs. S18-S22) — was tried next and also comes up empty.** It directly expands a Heisenberg-evolved single-sided Majorana operator in the basis of Majorana strings and checks the phase coherence R(l)=\|q(l)\|/P(l) and phase arg(q(l)) of the winding size distribution within each size sector — the paper's own "perfect size winding" signature would show that phase growing linearly with size l. Across 6 instances and 4 post-quench times (spot-checked first on 3 individual seeds spanning both correctly- and wrong-signed instances), the result is exact and uniform: R(l)=1.0000 and phase=0.0000 everywhere, for every instance tested — this diagnostic is structurally trivial here and, like mode-usage-imbalance and the level-spacing statistic, does not distinguish correctly- from wrong-signed instances. The mean operator size itself does show genuine chaos-consistent growth followed by finite-size recurrence, confirming the underlying operator-growth dynamics are real even though this particular phase diagnostic isn't the explanation. **A fourth honest negative result follows two more protocol-grounded candidates, tested together as Experiment 13 and correlated against the exact same n=100 sample used above (a real multiple-comparisons risk, flagged explicitly rather than glossed over).** Feature A, "message-mode participation": the Jordan-Wigner mapping shows Majorana modes 1 and 2 correspond exactly to the qubit the message is injected into and read out from, so this counts how often each instance's K=10 SYK terms specifically touch those two modes — sharper than the earlier all-modes-interchangeable usage-std. Feature B, "operator growth rate": reuses the size-winding computation's own non-trivial `<l>(t)` output (never previously correlated against the sign) at two probe times in its growth region. Neither correlates: message-mode participation r=-0.012 (p=0.90), growth rate at t=1.2 r=+0.126 (p=0.21) — both far from significance, ruling out a 4th and 5th candidate. **A fifth honest negative result, Experiment 14, tests the actual qubit-coupling *topology* — not just how many terms commute, or how many terms touch a given mode, but *which specific modes* get coupled together.** A weighted 8-mode co-occurrence graph is built per instance (edge weight = how many of the K=10 quads couple that pair of modes); an ad hoc check first found a *binary* version of this graph saturates to the complete graph for most instances (10 quads cover nearly all 28 possible pairs by chance) and is useless as a discriminator, so the weighted count is used instead. A second honest check, done after computing the real numbers: two of the four candidate features (max weighted degree, weighted degree std) turn out to be an exact linear rescaling of the mode-usage features already ruled out above (weighted degree = 3× usage count, verified to 1 part in 10^15) — not new information. The two genuinely new features — how many of the 28 possible mode pairs are never coupled at all, and the graph's algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value) — also fail to correlate (r=+0.159, p=0.11; r=-0.141, p=0.16), ruling out a 6th and 7th candidate. **Experiment 15 tries the one remaining structural lever nobody had pulled yet: system size.** Does the sign-dependent instance variance persist, worsen, or shrink at a larger Majorana count (N=12 vs. the N=8 used everywhere above)? The exact backend is infeasible at N=12 (dim^3 diagonalization cost, dim=16384 vs. N=8's 1024 -- a measured ~4096x slowdown), so both N=8 and N=12 are re-evaluated here via the Trotterized gate-circuit backend for a clean, backend-matched comparison, rather than mixing in the exact-backend N=8 numbers used above (which would confound N-scaling with a separately-quantified backend effect, per Experiment 9). n=6 instances per N (not n=100 -- infeasible at this cost), K_TERMS kept fixed at 10, and N=12 instances selected by closest-achievable match to the paper's 34/11 criterion since no exact match exists at that N (verified: 0 of 3000 candidates). Result: the wrong-sign rate is identical, 2/6 at both N, too small a sample to call a real rate -- but the mean |delta| magnitude drops from 0.00765 (N=8) to 0.00034 (N=12), **roughly a 22x reduction**, present in every N=12 instance individually, not just on average. Consistent with the signal weakening toward a thermodynamic limit, though also consistent with the paper's own default parameters (implicitly tuned for N=8) simply becoming less optimal as N grows -- this first look can't distinguish those two explanations, only establish that the drop itself is real. **Experiment 16 asks a different kind of non-commutativity question, inspired by this repo's own `channel_order_noncommutativity.py`** (which settled that NOISE-channel order matters iff at least one channel is non-Pauli -- the depolarizing channel used in Experiment 9 here is a Pauli mixture, so that rule predicts reordering noise channels wouldn't show anything new). Instead of channel order, this reorders the K=10+10 SYK Hamiltonian *terms themselves* within the Trotterized circuit (original vs. reversed), noiselessly, and measures how much that changes the delta -- `order_sensitivity`. An initial n=6 spot-check found a moderate, borderline-interesting `r=+0.474` (`p=0.342`) -- the largest point estimate of any candidate tried in this script, and unusually cheap to verify further (protocol setup is built once per instance and reused across all 4 Trotter calls, ~18s/instance) -- so it was checked on a larger sample before writing anything up, per this project's own established discipline. **Eighth honest negative result: at n=30, the correlation regresses to `r=+0.282` (`p=0.131`)** -- still not significant, and weaker than the n=6 look suggested, the same honest-correction pattern as the mode-usage-imbalance finding above (`r=0.87` at n=6 -> `r=0.171` at n=100). `order_sensitivity` itself is real and non-zero for every instance (term order genuinely changes the Trotterized circuit's output), it just doesn't predict the sign. **Experiment 17 asks the question Experiment 16's own caveat left open: does term-order sensitivity change once realistic noise is present?** Same method — original vs. reversed term order — but now with a depolarizing Kraus channel injected after each protocol phase (`noise_p=0.01`, Experiment 9's own near-threshold value), delta averaged over 6 noisy trials per order (common random numbers between mu signs to isolate the sign effect from trial-to-trial noise variance). **A first honest positive result since Experiment 9, and the only candidate in this entire script that does NOT regress to non-significance as the sample grows:** n=6, `r=+0.811` (`p=0.050`); n=20, `r=+0.587` (`p=0.0065`); n=30, `r=+0.396` (`p=0.030`); n=50 (34/11-exact-match screening, 38028 candidates screened), **`r=+0.340` (`p=0.0158`)** — the point estimate shrinks with n as expected from a true-but-modest effect regressing off an initially lucky small-sample draw, but it stabilizes around r≈0.34-0.40 instead of continuing toward zero, and stays under p=0.05 at every single sample size checked, unlike Experiment 16's own noiseless version of the same test (p=0.34 → p=0.13 over a comparable n range). 25/50 (50%) of the n=50 sample are wrong-signed, consistent with every other larger-n check here. Reading: term-order non-commutativity alone (pure Trotter error, Experiment 16) doesn't predict the sign, but its *interaction with physical noise* does, modestly — plausibly because noise and Trotter error both perturb the state away from the exact answer, and how sensitive an instance's term ordering is to that perturbation partly tracks how fragile its sign-dependent signal already is. Why the sign varies remains only partially explained. Along the way: `run_wormhole_protocol`'s ~4.5s/call cost turned out to be almost entirely a setup step that doesn't depend on t0/mu/t1 at all for a fixed instance — precomputing it once instead of once per grid point cut the 870-point search from an estimated ~2 hours to **47.6 seconds** (~165x), no multiprocessing needed.

## 🚀 Reproducing the Results

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/tatopenn-cell/Dense-Evolution-Discovery.git
cd Dense-Evolution-Discovery
pip install -r requirements-ci.txt

# Run the test suite (fast, ~2 minutes, no CSV/PNG needed)
pytest tests/ -v

# Or run the full experiments -- each creates data/*.csv and/or images/*.png,
# safe to run from the repo root regardless of your current directory:

`data/` and `images/` are gitignored -- they exist only after you run something, so it's always unambiguous whether what you're looking at is fresh. Pre-made results are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/tatopenn-cell/Dense-Evolution-Discovery/releases) instead.

> **Hardware note:** All benchmarks were executed on CPU. The JAX XLA engine will automatically utilize GPU acceleration if available via `use_gpu=True` in the simulator constructor.
